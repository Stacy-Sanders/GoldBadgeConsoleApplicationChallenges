# Gold Badge Challenges

As a Software Development student at Eleven Fifty Academy, a Gold Badge Challenge is the final step to pass in order to move onto the Blue Badge.

Using Visual Studio 2019, a minimum of three C# challenges are to be completed.

The three challenges I chose (in order of completion) included:
## 01 - Komodo Cafe
This challenge included creating repository project with an object class and a class acting as our repository, a console application to act as our user interface, and lastly a unit test if time allowed. 
We created a UI for the cafe manager to list the menu items, create new items, update items, and delete items. The items could be called by meal name.

## 06 - Komodo Green Plan
This challenge required us to create the same projects, while allowing the Komodo Insurance employee to sort and review information based on a vehicle's fuel type -
1. Standard Gas
2. Electric
3. Hybrid

## 03 - Komodo Badges
This challenge required the creation of a dictionary. I attempted this challenge and concluded that I needed more study in the use of dictionaries. I have kept my attempt intact so that I may improve upon it once I have enhanced my C# skill set.

## 04 - Komodo Outings
This challenge required us to create the same projects, while allowing the accountants at Komodo Insurance to view costs by outing type and total cost for all outings. This challenge did prove to be a challenge for me. This was my first experience at bringing a calculation over from my CRUD method in my repository.

It has been an eyeopening experience working on these challenges after two weeks of class. I hope to be able to continue my journey onto Blue Badge.
